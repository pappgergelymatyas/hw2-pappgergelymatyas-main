def division(a: int, b: int) -> tuple:  # No need to worry about this code right now
    """
    This function takes two integers, a and b, and returns two values:
    1. The result of integer division.
    2. The result of float division.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the result of integer division and float division.

    Note: You don't need to worry about the 'def' line or 'return' statement right now.
    Just focus on writing the correct expressions in the provided lines.

    # Write code to calculate the result of float division
    float_div_result = a / b  # You need to change this line to calculate float division

    # The return statement sends the two results back as a tuple
