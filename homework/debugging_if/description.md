# Task

You are given a function that takes an integer **num** and returns one of the following:

- "Positive" if **num** is greater than zero.
- "Negative" if **num** is less than zero.
- "Zero" if **num** is exactly zero.

However, the function contains some errors. Debug the function so that it works as intended.

# Example

**num** = 5

Return the following:

    "Positive"

# Input Format

A single integer, **num**.

# Constraints

$\ -10^{6} \leq num \leq 10^{6}$

# Output Format

Return a string indicating whether the number is "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero".

# Sample Input 0

    0

# Sample Output 0

    "Zero"

# Explanation 0

0 $\implies$ "Zero" because the number is exactly zero.
