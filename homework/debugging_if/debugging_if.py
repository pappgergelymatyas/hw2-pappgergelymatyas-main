    This function takes one integer, `num`, and returns whether the number is:
    - "Positive" if the number is greater than zero.
    - "Negative" if the number is less than zero.
    - "Zero" if the number is exactly zero.

    Parameters:
    num (int): The number to be checked.

    Returns:
    str: A string indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

    Note: You don't need to worry about the 'def' line or 'return' statement right now.
    Just focus on writing the correct expressions in the provided lines and fixing errors.
