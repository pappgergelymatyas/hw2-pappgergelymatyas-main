def countdown(n: int) -> list:  # No need to worry about this code right now

    This function takes an integer `n` and returns a list counting down from n to 1.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The starting number for the countdown.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing numbers from n down to 1.

    Note: You don't need to worry about the 'def' line or 'return' statement right now.
    Just focus on writing the correct expressions in the provided lines and fixing errors.
