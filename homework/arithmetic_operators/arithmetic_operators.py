def arithmetic_operators(

    """
    This function takes two integers, a and b, and returns three values:
    1. The sum of a and b.
    2. The difference of a and b.
    3. The product of a and b.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first integer.
    b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the sum, difference, and product of a and b.

    Note: You don't need to worry about the 'def' line or 'return' statement right now.
    Just focus on writing the correct expressions for each result in the provided lines. ads
