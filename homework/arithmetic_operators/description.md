# Task

There are two integers, **a** and **b**. Write a function that returns three values:

- The first is the sum of the two numbers.
- The second is the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
- The third is the product of the two numbers.

# Example

**a** = 3

**b** = 5

Return the following:

    8, -2, 15
# Input Format

Two integers, **a** and **b**.

# Constraints

1 <= **a** <= $10^{10}$

1 <= **b** <= $10^{10}$

# Output Format

Return the three values as explained above.

# Sample Input 0

    3, 2
# Sample Output 0

    5, 1, 6
# Explanation 0

3 + 2 $\implies$ 5

3 - 2 $\implies$ 1

3 * 2 $\implies$ 6
